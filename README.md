## Description

**Create Vehicles Additional** is an expansion for the [Create Mod](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create).

It introduces advanced engineering systems and large-scale technical mechanics, including:

- [Vehicle Creation](#vehicle-creation)
- [Steel Production](#steel-production)
- [Oil Processing](#oil-processing)
- [Carbon Processing](#carbon-processing)
- [Nuclear Engineering](#nuclear-engineering)


## Vehicle Creation

Build fully functional:

- Planes  
- Cars  
- Boats  
- Rockets  

The mod introduces a new physical engine system that removes previous technical limitations and enables realistic, large-scale vehicle construction.


## Steel Production

Adds a complete steel production chain including advanced smelting and industrial processing methods.

*(More details coming soon.)*


## Oil Processing

Extract, refine, and process oil into usable fuels and industrial materials.

*(More details coming soon.)*


## Carbon Processing

Advanced carbon handling and material synthesis systems for industrial-scale production.

*(More details coming soon.)*


## Nuclear Engineering

High-end engineering with nuclear systems for energy generation and advanced applications.

*(More details coming soon.)*
